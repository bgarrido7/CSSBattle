## OBJECTIVE 

 Write HTML/CSS in the editor and replicate the given target image in the least code possible. What you write, renders as it is 

## SCORING 

 The score is calculated based on the number of characters you use (the comments included :P) and how close you replicate the image. Read the FAQS (https://cssbattle.dev/faqs) for more info. 

Examples of images to replicate:
